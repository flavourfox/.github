FlavourFox is an intelligent recipe app. By showing the user recipes which they can rate by swiping left or right, the app creates a detailed mathematical profile of the userâ€™s food preferences. This way, the user receives highly personalized recipe suggestions. Combined with an efficient and sophisticated filtering system, no other app in the marketplace comes close to achieving this level of personalization and convenience.
