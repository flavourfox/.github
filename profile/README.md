## Intelligent Cooking

Cooking is one of the most enjoyable and relaxing activities a person can do. But it can also be frustrating when you don't have the time or the know-how to cook a particular dish. Wouldn't it be great if there was an app that could help you create a cooking plan based on your preferences and your budget? Well, that's exactly what Intelligent Cooking is designed to do.

Intelligent Cooking is an app that uses artificial intelligence to create a cooking plan for you. It takes into account not only your budget, difficulty and time, but also what you've already cooked and what you're likely to cook in the future. This way, Intelligent Cooking can create a plan that's tailored specifically to your needs and your tastes.

In addition to creating a cooking plan, Intelligent Cooking also provides an explorer mode where you can rate recipes and use them to feed the algorithm. This way, Intelligent Cooking can learn what you like and don't like and create plans that are even more tailored to your needs. So whether you're a beginner or a seasoned cook, Intelligent Cooking can help you achieve success and relaxation
